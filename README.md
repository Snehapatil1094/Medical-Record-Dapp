# Medical-Record-Dapp

Hi,
This is a MedicalRecord Dapp. 

Please refer to detailsOfAssignment folder where all the screen shots of testing, contract address, ABI, Bytecode and others details are kept. 

Please see the below steps that i have followed for this excersize.

1. Created the smart contract in solidity.
2. Deployed the smart contract over Rinkeby testnet from REMIX by using Metamask wallet.
3. The contract is fully tested on REMIX. All the functionality is working as expected.
4. All the solidity functions are tested and Tx hash have been saved and verified over etherscan.
5. Developed the deployContract.js file for the deployment(next time when we want to deploy).
6. Developed the query.js file to call all the smart contract functions.
7. Developed the nodejs API to divert the call between frond-end(index.html) file and Blockchain.


Due to the time constraint i couldnt really test the entire front-end and blockchain connection functionality. However the contract is fully tested using REMIX.
I had to finish this assignment in one day and send back.

Steps; 
1. Please clone this repository in your system
2. go to cd medicalRecord directory
3. download all the dependencies by using command- npm install
4. node app.js
5. to see the front-end development page please open the index.html page.
